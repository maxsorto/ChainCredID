# ChainCredID

ChainCredID is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to provide secure and verifiable attestation services on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging the advanced capabilities of Scroll L2 for scalability and efficiency, alongside the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for robust attestation processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Scroll L2**: A layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enhances transaction speed and reduces costs, making it ideal for dApps requiring high throughput.
- **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)**: A decentralized protocol for creating, storing, and verifying off-chain data with on-chain attestations, providing a secure and immutable verification mechanism.

## Contract Address

The smart contract for ChainCredID is deployed at `0x981F5a4F664A7c7cC601bEd121505B6d2fBD3C80` on the Scroll Layer 2 (Sepolia Testnet) network. You can verify the contract details and source code at [Sepolia ScrollScan](https://sepolia.scrollscan.dev/address/0x981f5a4f664a7c7cc601bed121505b6d2fbd3c80#code).

## Access the Application

- **Admin Portal**: [Admin Portal](https://chaincredid.pages.dev/admin)

## Overview

ChainCredID offers a user-friendly interface allowing individuals to have various rights and credentials attested within a secure and transparent environment. Utilizing the power of smart contracts, users can request attestations for rights such as voting, drinking, or entering the country. Administrators, on the other hand, can manage and verify these attestations through the admin portal, ensuring a robust and trustless verification process.

## Getting Started

To interact with ChainCredID, visit the home page and choose the relevant portal based on your role (user or admin). Ensure you have a compatible Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) connected to the Sepolia test network for transactions.

For users wishing to have their rights attested, navigate to the user portal, where you can submit your requests. Admins can review and process these requests via the admin portal, leveraging the functionalities provided by the Ethereum Attestation Service to ensure each attestation's integrity and verifiability.

## Future Developments

Post-ETH LATAM Hackathon 2024, the ChainCredID team is committed to continuing the development and improvement of the platform. We aim to integrate more features, enhance user experience, and expand the scope of attestable rights, further contributing to the Ethereum community's growth and the broader blockchain-based digital identity management ecosystem.
